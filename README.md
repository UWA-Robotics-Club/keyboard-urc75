## 👀 Overview

This repository contains all files and instructions for the "Build Your Own Keyboard" project created by the UWA Robotics Club. 

This project was designed to be a beginners introduction to building electronics, as well as serving as an interesting product that UWA Robotics Club members have genuine use for, and can use day to day.
