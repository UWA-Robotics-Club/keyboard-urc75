## Overview

This repository contains all files and instructions for the "Build Your Own Keyboard" project created by the UWA Robotics Club. 

This project was designed to be a beginners introduction to building electronics, as well as serving as an interesting product that UWA Robotics Club members have genuine use for, and can use day to day. 

**This project is fully opensource!**<br/>
All files to build your own "URC 75" from scratch, can be found in this respository, from the STEP files, to the schematics of the board, and the QMK firmware.
