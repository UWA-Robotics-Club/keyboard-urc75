# 3. Sockets

In this section, we will show you how to put your sockets onto your board and solder them in place 

# Preparing the sockets

  Get your reel of Sockets from your kit <br/>

The Sockets are contained in a Reel of Tape which has a plastic film on the top to stop the parts from falling out.

### Carefully remove ONLY the first 5-10 sockets worth of plastic film, NOT THE WHOLE THING 
If you remove all of the plastic film, then all of your sockets will be loose, and you will likely loose them or get them mixed up with another person.

  This is what the sockets look like, on this side there is two circular protrusions which have visible sockets in them. You can also see that it is clearly a soft L shape.  <br/>

This is the otherside of the socket, you can see that this side is flat, and has visible metal parts <br/>

Get your board from your kit and have a look at the back of it, you will see the outline of where you will place your sockets.  <br/>

You will need to place your so that it aligns with the outline. 
 <br/>

 ### CAUTION! : The sockets can be physically installed backwards, pleas ensure that your sockets are matching the orientation shown on the outline

The sockets have a metal contact "wings" which lay on the board and are soldered down, this is a SMD (Surface mount device) part which means that you place the part and solder it on the same side, rather than poking it through the board( like the diodes)

When placed on the PCB you will notice that the socket's "wings" are a "U" shape. To solder the "wings" of the sockets down to the board, place your soldering iron inside the channel and heat it up for around 4-5 seconds, then add your solder into the 'U'.<br/>

The solder joint should look like this<br/>

### TIP : In my experience the best way to solder these sockets is to solder one "wing", and then wait for it to cool, then try and wiggle the socket, if it DOES NOT move, you have likely soldered correctly and can solder the other side. IF it DOES move, your solder joint has not made connection to the board, remelt the solder and it may wick to the PCB.

### CAUTION! : The "Wings" are made of metal and the rest of the socket is made of a plastic. If you overheat your socket, you can melt the plastic part of your socket.
### CAUTION! : The "Wings" are made of metal IF YOU TOUCH IT BEFORE IT COOLS DOWN, IT WILL BURN YOU

Solder all of your sockets<br/>

# Well Done ! You have soldered all of the sockets!
