## Build your own Keyboard - URC 75

# 2. Diodes 

In this section, we will show you how to bend your diodes with a 3d printed bending jig, place them all in place on your board, and solder them.

# Bending the Diodes 



![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Bending_Diodes/1.JPG)
  Get your Ribbon of diodes from your hardware kit , and request a Diode bender jig <br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Bending_Diodes/2.JPG)
  Put your diodes in the center of the SMALLER piece of the diode jig , **ensure that the diodes are centered to ensure the diode is centered when placed on the board<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Bending_Diodes/3.JPG)
  Put the LARGER piece on top and ensure that the notches are lined up with the diode legs  <br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Bending_Diodes/4.JPG)
  Carefully Flip the assembly around so the LARGER piece is on the bottom  <br/>

 Cut the Diode ribbon so that the you are only bending the diodes that are in the jig  <br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Bending_Diodes/6.JPG)
  Push down firmly on the top piece <br/>

  Push down firmly on the top piece, until it looks like this <br/>

   <br/>

  Your diodes are now bent,Remove them, and return them to your hardware kit to not get them confused with anyone else, then bend the rest of your diodes <br/>

  Each Diode should look like this when removed from the paper strips,  <br/>


# Remove the Rails from the Circuit Board
![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/1.JPG)
Take your Circuit board from the Kit  <br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/2.JPG)
Remove the bubble Wrap and put it in the bin   <br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/3.JPG)
Notice that some parts are already soldered onto the board, near the usb port   <br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/4.JPG)
 And that there are RGB LEDS already soldered on the board under each switch  <br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/5.JPG)
 Also notice that there are "rails" on the board which I have marked in red here, These are added to help with manufacturing but must be removed to continue  <br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/6.JPG)
 **Be VERY CAREFUL** the board is made of fiberglass and there is the potential to get fiberglass splinters if you are not careful  <br/>



![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/8.JPG)
 Carefully break off one corner of the rail,  <br/>




![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/11.JPG)
 then slowly tear them off   <br/>


![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/14.JPG)
 Put the rails that you have just removed in the bin.   <br/>

# Thread the Diodes through the Circuit Board 
![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/15.JPG)
 To familiarise you with the circuit board, this image (showing the USBC port) is the TOP of the Circuit board, it is what will be faceing UP when the board is assembled,     <br/>

 ![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/16.JPG)
 Notice that the TOP face of the circuit board has markings at the top edge of the board which look like diodes, AND that they have a stripe to indicate the direction to install the diodes  <br/>

  ![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/20.JPG)
 ### **NOTICE THE BLACK STRIPE ON THE DIODE** You will need to align this with the BLACK STRIPE on the PCB   <br/>

 ![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/19.JPG)
 ### **NOTICE THE BLACK STRIPE ON THE DIODE IS ALIGNED WITH THE STRIPE ON THE PCB**   <br/>

   ![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/21.JPG)
 The Legs of the Diode will stick through and out the other side of the PCB, 
 
 In order to make the it more comfortable, you can wedge the bag of switches from your kit under your board to "prop up" the circuit board while you install your diodes <br/>

 ![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Thread_Diodes_Through/someone%20else%20check.JPG)
 ### **Have someone else check that all of your diodes are facing the right way before you move forward, as if you solder a diode backwards the key it is wired to will not work.** <br/>

 # Tape down the Diodes
 ![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Tape_down_Diodes/1.JPG)
  Once you are happy with that all of your diodes are placed in the right way, and are centered in each opening, you will need to tape them down in order to stop them from moving when you go to solder them
  
 ### Ask for a piece of tape from a URC member running the workshop
  <br/>

 
 ![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Tape_down_Diodes/3.JPG)
  Make sure you press down the tape as shown so that the diodes cant move from under the tape while you solder. 
<br/>

 ![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Tape_down_Diodes/4.JPG)
  The back of your board should still look like this, with all the legs of the diodes sticking out. 
<br/>

# Soldering the Diodes

 ![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/1.JPG)
  Take your board to a soldering workstation, and place it face down as shown 
<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/2.JPG)
  Be Safe, ensure you have a clean area to work and that it is ventilated or has an exhaust system 
<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/3.JPG)
  Take your Soldering iron (hot) and first tin the tip, then bring it to your first diode

  **It is a good idea to start with the bottom row of diodes, and solder them completely, then clip the lead before moving forward to give yourself access to the next row of diodes** 
<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/4.JPG)
  Place the tip of the iron on both the pad(on the pcb) and the leg of the diode, hold it there for around 3 seconds 
<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/6.JPG)
  Then touch the solder to the pad, you do not need much solder, only around 1-2mm. Then quickly pull away 
<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/Just%20soldered%20the%20first%20lead.png)
  If done correctly, the solder joint should look like a small piramid which completely covers the pad on the circuit board
<br/>

### It is ok if your first solder joints are not perfect, this is a great project because you get to do the exact same type of solder joint around 160 times, which will really help grow your skill and hopefully you notice that you get better and faster toward the end. Take your time, and ask for help if you are stuck :) 
<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/8.JPG)
  Your solder joint should look like this.
<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/9.JPG)
  Solder Just the bottom row of Diode legs 
<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/11.JPG)
  Ask for some snippers and cut off the extra length of the legs which you have just soldered, so you will have access to the leads one row up 

  ### The cut legs will likely shoot off when snipped, make sure you and people around you are wearing eye protection
<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/12.JPG)
 The snipped solder joints done need to be pretty, they just need to not be touching each other. 
<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/17.JPG)
 Be careful not to connect your legs together as you can "smush" the leads together if you snip them at the same time 
<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/21.JPG)
Repeat the above steps until you have soldered and snipped all of your diodes 
<br/>

![image](/Build_Instructions/2_Diodes_Img/Solder%20the%20Diodes/22.JPG)
Flip the board over and remove the masking tape  
<br/>

# Well Done ! You have soldered all of the Diodes for your keyboard! 

Next you will solder the Keyswitch Sockets!
