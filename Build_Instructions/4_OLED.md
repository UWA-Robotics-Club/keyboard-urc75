  Go and retreive the OLED Display from your kit <br/>

  The OLED display is placed on the TOP side of your main board, and then soldered from behind. <br/>

  The OLED's pins disable it from sitting flat on the surface of the PCB, you can decide if you would like your OLED to hover parrallel to the PCB or if you would like it to slope down against the PCB. 
  
  There is no functional difference between these two options, its just aethestics and personal taste. <br/>

  I prefer the "parrallel" style, so I have put a piece of foam on the underside of my OLED as a spacer while I am soldering <br/>

### TIP : Not shown in the photos, but a good idea would be to tape the display in place before soldering so it can not move. Similar to how you did the

  Turn your board over and solder just the top and bottom pins<br/>

  Turn your board over to the front and ensure that the display is straight, this photo shows a display that is slightly tilted down<br/>

  Since you only soldered the top and bottom pins, You can remelt your solder joints and turn the OLED so that it is straight.<br/>

  Solder the remaining 2 pins.<br/>

# Well Done ! You have soldered the OLED Display!
