    - Print a new case in a new colour 
    - Rebuild the firmware 
        - new animation

        - change the 4 user keys to another function

- Write a "lessons learned" page with information on what design choices we would change for a "version 2" 
    - More modularity in the Design 
    - More testing ahead of time 
    - More focus on the tracking costs 
    - Think from the customers perspective
    - have the github ready ahead of the launch of the product
