# FDM Cases 

## TLDR:
Our 3D-printed resin cases for the "Build your own keyboard kit" have several issues including warping, poor tolerances, and discoloration.

As a solution, we're transitioning to FDM-printed cases. I am currently discussing with URC whether costs will be sponsored by the club or paid by customers (approx $5-$10 pp). 

Updates on this issue will be shared via GitHub and email.

Thank you :) - William Craig

# ðŸš¨ Problem
## What has happened?
We contracted an overseas supplier to 3D print resin cases for our "Build your own keyboard kit." Unfortunately, the material properties of the resin have resulted in several significant issues that affect functionality and durability.

### What are the problems with the original cases?
The resin cases have multiple issues:

- Severe warping that affects fit and assembly
- Poor tolerances on heat set insert holes
- The resin responds poorly to heat set inserts, making proper installation difficult
- Discoloration and yellowing with exposure to sunlight

### Why did we buy resin cases? 
Initially, resin cases were chosen for their superior surface finish and aesthetic appeal. We expected them to provide a premium look for the keyboard kits, similar to injection moulding. Unfortunately, the material limitations outweighed these benefits.

## What should I do if I bought a kit already?
If you've already purchased a kit, please hold off on assembling your keyboard if possible. We'll be in touch via email with specific options. If you've already assembled your keyboard, don't worry - we'll ensure you have access to a functional replacement case.

## Do I need to buy a NEW case if I already bought a kit?
I am currently discussing with URC whether costs will be sponsored by the club or paid by customers (approx $5-$10 pp). I would vastly prefer not to charge customers for cases which should be in the kit, as such I will ensure there is some form of compensation for those who have already purchased a kit, if this is the case.


# âœ… Solution
## New FDM Cases 
We're transitioning to FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printing technology for the cases.

**I do not just want to REPLACE the keyboard cases, I intend to make them BETTER.**

### Why is FDM better? 
- Can be printed "in house"
- Reduced cost (near 3x cost reduction over resin cases)
- More reliable material properties
    - No Warping 
    - Reliable heat set insert 
    - No discolouration
    - Case dimensions and tolerances can be changed with no cost
- Ability to customise Colour and style PER CUSTOMER 

### New BambuLab P1S Printer with 2 AMS Units
Since ordering the first batch of keyboard kits, I have purchased a Bambulab P1S 3d Printer which I can use to print the replacement cases.

### Multicolour Case Designs
Thanks to the 2 AMS units with my P1S printer, I am able to print the cases with up to 8 colours. These colours are printed into the case, not a paint or sticker. This means that the design will never scratch or peel off.

See a proof of concept design below:

### Investigating Custom Options
I intend to make several "pre-made" designs which people can pick from.

However the flexibility of FDM allows the opportunity for custom designed cases. I am open to this possibility, however I will focus on "pre-made" designs first, before offering custom options. 

## Final Conclusions
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. I have created and am in the process of implementing a solution which will (with luck) improve the quality, customisability and personality of your URC75 keyboard. 

Thank you for your understanding and patience while this solution gets rolled out.
